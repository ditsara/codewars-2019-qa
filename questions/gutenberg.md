Gutenberg
=========

It's the year 1400 and you are printing a book on your printing press.

To print a page, you arrange each character on the press to form the words.
However, you only have the following quantities of each character in your
printing set:

```
[["a", 35],
 ["b", 8],
 ["c", 8],
 ["d", 20],
 ["e", 70],
 ["f", 20],
 ["g", 10],
 ["h", 40],
 ["i", 35],
 ["k", 5],
 ["l", 20],
 ["m", 8],
 ["n", 30],
 ["o", 40],
 ["p", 10],
 ["q", 2],
 ["r", 35],
 ["s", 35],
 ["t", 40],
 ["u", 15],
 ["v", 5],
 ["w", 18],
 ["y", 8],
 ["z", 2]]
```

When you run out of characters, you need to start a new page.

Assumptions:

- There is no maximum limit to the number of characters you can have per page
  (other than the number you have in your set)
- No difference between capital and lowercase letters
- Ignore all numbers, spaces, returns, special characters, and characters
  missing in the list above
