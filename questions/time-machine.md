# Time Machine

I built a time machine!
It starts today, Saturday 14 December 2019.

Every time I press the big red button, it should go into the future exactly 1
year, so after I press the button once it's Monday 14 December 2020.

The machine goes into the future to the same day and month of the
following year, regardless of leap years.

But my time machine has two bugs!

- If it's February 29th (in a leap year), pressing the red button makes the
  time machine explode
- If it's a Tuesday, pressing the red button makes the time machine go
  backwards 2 days into the past

If I keep pressing the red button,
in what year will I be when the time machine explodes?
