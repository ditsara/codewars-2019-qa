# Grid

Starting from position x=0, y=0, follow the instructions in
directions.txt (grid/directions.txt)
to move step by step either `NORTH`, `SOUTH`, `EAST `or `WEST` by a number of
units.

For example, the first instruction is `NORTH 2` so you will be at x=0, y=2.
The second instruction is `WEST 3` so you will be at x=-3, y=2.

Where do you finish?
